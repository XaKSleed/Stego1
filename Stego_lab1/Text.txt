In Steganography the useless bits are actually replaced by the useful bits 
in order to hide the required file into any of the files or data mentioned above. It plays a vital role in cybersecurity by allowing legitimate users or peers to send the data in a way which is highly secured so that it could be protected from the hacker or malicious users who are intended to harm or abuse the system. 
It can be done using software that is available in the market for free or paid.
Steganography can also be considered as the practice of concealing the crucial data into any of the files so that it could be transmitted securely. The applications like SteganPEG, OpenStego and so on are used to fulfill the purpose of wrapping up one file into the another. 
The applications used for Steganography hides the bits of the required file into another file in a manner so that the original file doesn’t lose its characteristics. It can be considered pretty more secure than encryption
or hashing as in these cases the attacker can sniff at least the junks but in the case of Steganography, they won’t be able to detect if anything important has been transmitted. It is usually applied at a place where the data has to be sent secretly.
As we discussed earlier, it plays a vital role in cybersecurity. It is very useful when it comes to sending the data secretly from one point to another without letting anyone know that the other or critical file has been sent. 
In organizations, data security has to be kept on the priority as it defines the reputation of the organization. In some cases where the message has to be sent very secretly, it really makes the working very easy to transmit the data very securely. The actual usage of Steganography can be seen in the military of any country.
All the data they send from one point to another has to be very very secured as their data’s are actually very critical. They leverage Steganography to protect the data in order to perform their operations very securely.
In order to work with Steganography, we have several applications available in the market. As we mentioned earlier OpenStego, SteganPEG is some of the applications that are used to implement Steganography. The data that has been required to be wrapped and the data under which it has to be wrapped, both are being used by the application to merge them in a specific way. 
Working with these applications is very simple so that even someone from a nontechnical background can also use it properly. The application works in a manner like, it asks the user to upload the file that has to be hidden and then it asks to upload the file under which the first has to be hidden, 
then it processes both of the files with the algorithm in order to hide one under another one.

Depends upon whether you want to use the application for Steganography or you need to develop an application that is based on Steganography, the required skills varies. If you just want to work with the application that is used for Steganography, you just need the basic understanding of the computer system and you should know how to work 
with any application and that is all required to hide one file into the another. But if you want to develop an application that can implement the Steganography methodology that in that case you will be required to know to work with programming languages. You should know how to code so that you can develop the frontend and backend of the application. In addition to that, you will be required to have a 
deep knowledge of Steganography and it working so that you can design an application that can offer a solution for the requirements of Steganography.
Mainly Steganography is used by someone who belongs to the cybersecurity background in order to protect the data privacy. In organizations, or in the military there are specialists present there who hides the data before sending it from one point to another. So if we talk about the best audience to learn Steganography technologies, the cybersecurity professional or the application developers who have to develop the software that implements the mechanism of Steganography can be the best audience. They can master this technology so that they can serve their organization at the best and can contribute to protecting the data from getting disclosed to unauthorized users.
Steganography is one of the most important methodologies used in cybersecurity in order to protect the crucial data before getting transmitted to the public or private network. It is leveraged by military and organizations to transmit a critical message from one host to another. If anyone wants to grow their career in cybersecurity, it is something that they should know how to work with in order to get an edge into their existing skill set. One can learn it and can make the door of opportunities open for them in several large organization as all of them uses this technology very frequently throughout their crucial operations.

Working with these applications is very simple so that even someone from a nontechnical background can also use it properly. The application works in a manner like, it asks the user to upload the file that has to be hidden and then it asks to upload the file under which the first has to be hidden, 
then it processes both of the files with the algorithm in order to hide one under another one.
Steganography can also be considered as the practice of concealing the crucial data into any of the files so that it could be transmitted securely. The applications like SteganPEG, OpenStego and so on are used to fulfill the purpose of wrapping up one file into the another. 
The applications used for Steganography hides the bits of the required file into another file in a manner so that the original file doesn’t lose its characteristics. It can be considered pretty more secure than encryption
or hashing as in these cases the attacker can sniff at least the junks but in the case of Steganography, they won’t be able to detect if anything important has been transmitted. It is usually applied at a place where the data has to be sent secretly.
As we discussed earlier, it plays a vital role in cybersecurity. It is very useful when it comes to sending the data secretly from one point to another without letting anyone know that the other or critical file has been sent. 
In organizations, data security has to be kept on the priority as it defines the reputation of the organization. In some cases where the message has to be sent very secretly, it really makes the working very easy to transmit the data very securely. The actual usage of Steganography can be seen in the military of any country.
All the data they send from one point to another has to be very very secured as their data’s are actually very critical. They leverage Steganography to protect the data in order to perform their operations very securely.
In order to work with Steganography, we have several applications available in the market. As we mentioned earlier OpenStego, SteganPEG is some of the applications that are used to implement Steganography. The data that has been required to be wrapped and the data under which it has to be wrapped, both are being used by the application to merge them in a specific way.
